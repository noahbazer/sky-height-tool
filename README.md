# Sky: Children of the Light Height Tool

This is a tool I made after the original height tool (made by NathanWolf, big credit to him) became deprecated. This tool uses the new town location and multiple reference points to be as accurate as possible. 
The results are PLAYER-BASED, meaning that any new tallest or shortest heights will adjust and refine the existing min/max.

You have a height not measurable by the tool? Send starkidd a message on discord.
